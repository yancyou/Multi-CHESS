======== Task Description ========  
  
You are an SQL database expert tasked with correcting and improving a SQL query. A previous attempt to run a query did not yield the correct results, either due to errors in execution, empty results, or unexpected outputs. Your role is to analyze the issue and provide up to **three corrected SQL queries** (SQL1, SQL2, and SQL3) which work together to fully answer the question.  
  
- **If only one query is needed**, include your final solution in `<SQL_1>` and set `<SQL_2>` and `<SQL_3>` to empty strings ("").  
- **If two queries are needed**, include your first solution in `<SQL_1>`, your second solution in `<SQL_2>`, and set `<SQL_3>` to an empty string ("").  
- **If three queries are needed**, fill all three tags: `<SQL_1>`, `<SQL_2>`, and `<SQL_3>`.  

**Procedure:**
1. Review Database Schema:
	- Examine the table creation statements to understand the database structure.
2. Analyze Query Requirements:
	- Original Question: Consider what information the query is supposed to retrieve.
	- Executed SQL Query: Review the SQL query that was previously executed and led to an error or incorrect result.
	- Execution Result: Analyze the outcome of the executed query to identify why it failed (e.g., syntax errors, incorrect column references, logical mistakes).
3. Correct the Query: 
	- Modify the SQL query to address the identified issues, ensuring it correctly fetches the requested data according to the database schema and query requirements.

======== Your Task ========  
------------------------------  
【Table creation statements】  
{DATABASE_SCHEMA}  
  
------------------------------  
The original question is:  
Question:  
{QUESTION}  
  
The SQL query executed was:  
{QUERY}  
  
The execution result:  
{RESULT}  
  
------------------------------  
Based on the question, table schemas, and the previous query, analyze the result and attempt to fix or improve the query.  
  
1. **Detailed Analysis**:  
   - Analyze the provided query and the execution result in detail.  
   - Identify the errors or issues in the query (e.g., incorrect logic, missing conditions, or wrong table/column usage).  
   - Explain how you will correct or improve the query to align with the original question.  
  
2. **Generate Up to Three SQL Queries**:  
   - Determine how many queries are needed to fully solve the problem (1, 2, or 3).  
   - If you only need **one** query, place it in `<SQL_1>` and set `<SQL_2>` and `<SQL_3>` to `""`.  
   - If you need **two** queries, place them in `<SQL_1>` and `<SQL_2>` and set `<SQL_3>` to `""`.  
   - If you need **three** queries, place each query in `<SQL_1>`, `<SQL_2>`, and `<SQL_3>`.  
  
3. **Output the Queries**:  
   - The queries must be output in the following XML format:  
     ```  
     <FINAL_ANSWER>  
     <SQL_1>Your first corrected SQL query as a single line.</SQL_1>  
     <SQL_2>Your second corrected SQL query as a single line (or empty if not used).</SQL_2>  
     <SQL_3>Your third corrected SQL query as a single line (or empty if not used).</SQL_3>  
     </FINAL_ANSWER>  
     ```
